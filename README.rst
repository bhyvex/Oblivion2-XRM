Oblivion/2 XRM
===============

A text based bulletin board system served over Telnet.
XRM for (Extreme Remake) is my attempt to recreate and emulate one of the most popular DOS based BBS software with its one of a kind interface and configurability.


Project details
===============

**The system is still in very early development and is not a working system as of yet.**

You can follow the **changelog** in the root folder for progress updates.

Main development is current under Windows with releases planned for Linux, OSX, ARM.

Using CodeLite http://codelite.org/ IDE for W32/64 and Linux Workspace(s).

Built under C++ with Boost and compiles under g++ MingW32/64 5.1.0 using latest c++14.


Follow Project Status `Project Tracker <https://github.com/M-griffin/Oblivion2-XRM/projects/1>`_


Development Goals
=================
The initial goal is to implement all legacy system actions in use on the default setup/install.
With options for extended customization added later on to keep progress going.


Progress Notes
===============
Screen shot showing some of the latest work on the menu system.
The default theme template and menu prompt in action while switching menus.
The menu system is still pretty raw and a lot of logic still needs to be completed.
